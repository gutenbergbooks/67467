    <p class="verse">After all, what does a man amount to?</p>
    <p class="verse">It only takes some twenty—thirty—years or so</p>
    <p class="verse">To make a man, with everything complete.</p>
    <p class="verse">Longer, it is true, than growing cabbages</p>
    <p class="verse">Or currant bushes, or a cow,—</p>
    <p class="verse">Or a fair-sized hog;</p>
    <p class="verse">But not so very long, and there’s always time.</p>
    <p class="verse">When breeding’s good we get them fast enough....</p>
    <p class="verse">Merely a matter of waiting till they grow....</p>
    <p class="verse">Some food and clothes must be supplied—</p>
    <p class="verse">And shelter—and all that—</p>

Art and Anarchism
</h2>

</div>

<p class="aut">
MARGARET C. ANDERSON
</p>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">W</span><span class="postfirstchar">hen</span> “they” ask you what anarchism is, and you scuffle around for
the most convincing definition, why don’t you merely ask instead:
“What is art?” Because anarchism and art are in the world for exactly
the same kind of reason.
</p>

<p>
An anarchist is a person who realizes the gulf that lies between government
and life; an artist is a person who realizes the gulf that lies
between life and love. The former knows that he can never get from the
government what he really needs for life; the latter knows that he can
never get from life the love he really dreams of.
</p>

<p>
Now there is only one class of people—among the very rich or the
very poor or the very middling—that doesn’t know about these things.
It is the uneducated class. It is composed of housewives, business men,
church-goers, family egoists, club women, politicians, detectives, debutantes,
drummers, Christian Scientists, policemen, demagogues, social climbers,
ministers who recommend plays like <em>Experience</em>, etc., etc. It even includes
some who may be educated—journalists, professors, philanthropists,
patriots, “artistic” people, sentimentalists, cowards, and the insane. It is
the great middle-class mind of America. It is the kind of mind that
either doesn’t think at all or that thinks like this: “Without the violence
and the plotting there would be nothing left of anarchism but a dead
theory. Without the romance of it anarchism would be nothing but a
theory which will not work and never can until nature has evolved something
very different out of man. It is cops and robbers, hare and hounds,
Ivanhoe and E. Phillips Oppenheim all acted out in life. It is not really
dangerous to society, but only to some members of it, because unless every
one is against it there is no fun in it.”
</p>

<p>
There is no fun talking about anarchism to people who understand it.
But it would be great fun to make the middle-class mind understand
it. This is the way I should go about it:
</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="noindent">
What things do you need in order to live? Food, clothing, shelter.
What things <em>must</em> you have to get life out of the process of living? Love,
work, recreation. All right.
</p>

<p>
Does the government give you the first three things? Not at all. It
isn’t the government or law or anything of that sort that gives you food
or clothes. It’s the efficient organization between those who produce these
things and those who sell them to you. And it isn’t government that keeps
<a id="page-4" class="pagenum" title="4"></a>
that organization efficient. It’s the brains of those who work in it. You
will say that government exists to prevent that organization from charging
you too much for food and clothes. <em>Then why doesn’t government do it?</em>
Heaven knows you’ve got all the government you can very well use and
you pay too much for everything.
</p>

<p>
Does the government give you a house? If you happen to be an
ambassador or something like that. Not if you happen to be a mail man.
Maybe some one leaves you a house—which means that he once bought it
or stole it or had it left to him. You can do any of these three things
yourself. Or you can go without, as nearly every one else does. Sometimes
the government helps you to steal one—but not you of the middle-class. What I want to know is why <em>you</em> are so crazy about the government?
</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="noindent">
Now, about work. What do you call work?—spending eight hours a
day in an office to help make somebody’s business a success, and incidentally
to earn the money for your bread and butter? But that’s a third of
the time you’re given on earth. Another third has to be spent in sleep,
and the last third in eating your dinner, “spending the evening,” getting
undressed, getting dressed, eating your breakfast, and catching your train.
I call that slavery. Work is something over which you can toil twenty-four
hours a day if you feel like it, because if you don’t your life will
have no meaning. It’s like art. What has the government to do with
your work? About as much as it had to do with Marconi’s brain when
he was conceiving his wireless.
</p>

<p>
What do you call recreation?—lounging in hotel lobbies, gossiping
over tea tables, going to the movies? All right. But what has the government
got to do with it? Or do you call it walking, riding, reading, lying
in the sun? The government doesn’t give you good legs or a motor car
or books or a stretch of beach to lie on. But it can keep some of the best
books away from you and close up the bathing beaches on the hottest
October day. Maybe you call recreation what it really means: <em>re-creation</em>.
That means the time and the leisure to invite your soul. You’ve got government:
have you got either time or leisure?
</p>

<p>
And as for love.... You love some one who loves you, and
the world is good. Or you love some one who doesn’t love you and the
world is hell. Or you love and love and can find no one to love. Or you
love and cannot give, or love and cannot take, or maybe you cannot love
at all. And where is the government all this time?
</p>

<p>
The government can bring you a letter from some one you love. But
why must even that be done with graft?
</p>

<p>
Some one assaults a woman in a dark alley, you say, and where would
we be without the government? What has that to do with love, first?
Now clear up your minds: have you ever imagined why these things
<a id="page-5" class="pagenum" title="5"></a>
happen? Because some people are vicious, you say. But every one is
vicious—every one who has life in him. You are: only you can take it
out on your wife or on whatever prostitutes you can afford, or in eating
large dinners, or in joy rides, in vulgar parties, in the movies, in luxury,
in fads, in art, even in religion. It just depends upon your type. The
point is that you have your outlets and the other wretch hasn’t. And
second, since these things are always happening and you have plenty of
chances to see how the government deals with them, the only sensible
question left for you to ask is: <em>Why aren’t they dealt with?</em> You’ve
got government and you’ve got crime on the increase. May it be that
you will ever see this: that the thing needs <em>treat-ment</em>, not <em>govern-ment</em>?
</p>

<p>
But if you’re talking about love.... In love you will act just
like a cave man or an Athenian or an early Christian or an Elizabethan
or a modern, like a satyr or a traveling salesman or an artist—it depends
upon your type. Governments may come and go, may change or cease
to be, and nothing remains forever except “your type.”
</p>

<p>
But it’s just here that your government has its functions. It can
do various things. And since the value of your life depends upon the
intensity with which you love something or somebody, you might as well
recognize what your government can do for you in this regard:
</p>

<p>
If you think that love and freedom ought to go together the government
can put you in prison.
</p>

<p>
If you marry out of respect for the government, and grow to hate
each other, the government won’t give you a divorce out of respect for you.
</p>

<p>
If you marry as a concession to the government, because you don’t
want to ruin your business or have your wife insulted, the government
will divorce you—and on the concession basis: but you pay for both the
concessions.
</p>

<p>
If you believe that love is love, whether it brings you children or not,
you may be happy and prosperous, but you will not be safe. The government
can put your physician in prison.
</p>

<p>
If you’re very poor or very ill, and ought not have children, the
government can keep information for prevention away from you; and it
can put any one who tries to give you that information in prison.
</p>

<p>
If you should die from an abortion—and you surely will die if you
contract blood-poisoning; and you surely will do that if you must be
treated in secrecy and without skill—the government can hang your
physician.
</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="noindent">
Why are you so crazy about the government?
</p>

<p>
Why do you want to govern anything or anybody?—even your own
temper? Nietzsche said not to preserve yourself but to discharge yourself!
Why not <em>use</em> your temper as well as your nice moods?
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-6" class="pagenum" title="6"></a>
Why do you want to govern your child? To give him character?
But who ever told you that life is for the making of character? Even
if it were, you can’t give your child character. He can get it by going
through a great deal. But if you govern him successfully he won’t go
through a great deal. He will just be something that is like something
else. He won’t be himself.
</p>

<p>
Why do you want to govern human nature? Because you want
people to be good instead of bad? But how can you tell when they’re
good and when they’re bad? Suppose you all agree that Jean Crones did
a very bad thing? If you knew Jean Crones you should probably all
see at once that he is a very good man—if he exists at all. Clear up
your thinking!
</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="noindent">
Who ever told you that an anarchist wants to change human nature?
Who ever told you that an anarchist’s ideal could never be attained until
human nature had improved? Human nature will never “improve.” It
doesn’t matter much whether you have a good nature or a bad one. It’s
your thinking that counts. Clean out your minds!
</p>

<p>
If you believe these things—no, that is not enough: if you live them—you
are an anarchist. You can be one right now. You needn’t wait
for a change in human nature, for the millennium, or for the permission
of your family. Just be one!
</p>

<p>
You have seen that “the blind, heavy, stupid thing we call government”
can not give you a happy childhood. It cannot educate you or
make you an interesting person. It cannot give you work, art, love, or
life—or death if you think it is better to die.
</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="noindent">
And finally when you see that you can never get all the love you
imagined from life; that you are trapped, really, and must find a way
out; when you see that here where there is nothing is the way out, and
that the wonder of life begins here—when you see all this you will be an
artist, and your love that is “left over” will find its music or its words.

SHERWOOD ANDERSON
</p>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">H</span><span class="postfirstchar">e</span> was a man of forty-five, vigorous and straight of body. About his
jaws was a slight heaviness, but his eyes were quiet. In his young
manhood he had been involved in a scandal that had made him a marked
man in the community. He had deserted his wife and children and had
run away with a serious, dark-skinned young girl, the daughter of a Methodist
minister.
</p>

<p>
After a few years he had come back into the community and had
opened a law office. The social ostracism set up against him and his wife
had in reality turned out to their advantage. He had worked fiercely and
the dark-skinned girl had worked fiercely. At forty-five he had risen to
wealth and to a commanding position before the bar of his state, and his
wife, now a surgeon, had a fast-growing reputation for ability.
</p>

<p>
It was night and he sat in a room with the dead body of his younger
brother, who had gone the road he had traveled in his twenties. The
brother, a huge good-natured fellow, had been caught and shot in the home
of a married woman.
</p>

<p>
In the room with the lawyer sat a woman. She was a nurse, in charge
of the children of his second wife, a magnificent blonde creature with
white teeth. They sat beside a table, spread with <a id="corr-3"></a>books and magazines.
</p>

<p>
The woman who sat with the lawyer in the room with the dead man,
was, like himself, flush with life. He remembered, with a start, that she had
been introduced into the house by the boy who was dead. He began to
couple them in his mind and talked about it.
</p>

<p>
“You were in love with him, eh?” he asked presently.
</p>

<p>
The woman said nothing. She sat under a lamp with her legs
crossed. The lamplight fell upon her shapely shoulders.
</p>

<p>
The lawyer, getting out of his chair, walked up and down the room.
He thought of his wife, the woman he loved, asleep upstairs, and of the
price they had paid for their devotion to each other.
</p>

<p>
“It is barbarous, this old custom of sitting up with the dead,” he
said, and, going to another part of the house, returned with a bottle of
wine and two glasses.
</p>

<p>
With the wine before them the lawyer and the woman sat looking
at each other. They stared boldly into each other’s eyes, each concerned
with his own thoughts. A clock ticked loudly and the woman moved
uneasily. By an open window the wind stirred a white curtain and tossed
<a id="page-11" class="pagenum" title="11"></a>
it back and forth above the coffin, black and ominous. He began thinking
of the years of hard, unremittent labor and of the pleasures he had
missed. Before his eyes danced visions of white-clad dinner tables, with
men and bare-shouldered women sitting about. Again he walked up and
down the room.
</p>

<p>
Upon the table lay a magazine, devoted to farm life, and upon the
cover was a scene in a barn yard. A groom was leading a magnificent
stallion out at the door of a red barn.
</p>

<p>
Pointing his finger at the picture, the lawyer began to talk. A new
quality came into his voice. His hand played nervously up and down
the table. There was a gentle swishing sound of the blown curtain across
the top of the coffin.
</p>

<p>
“I saw one once when I was a boy,” he said, pointing with his finger
at the stallion.
</p>

<p>
He approached and stood over her.
</p>

<p>
“It was a wonderful sight,” he said, looking down at her. “I have
never forgotten it. The great animal was all life, vibrant, magnificent
life. Its feet scarcely touched the ground.”
</p>

<p>
“We are like that,” he added, leaning over her. “The men of our
family have that vibrant, conquering life in us.”
</p>

<p>
The woman arose from the chair and moved toward the darkened
corner where the coffin stood. He followed slowly. When they had gone
thus across the room she put up her hand and plead with him.
</p>

<p>
“No, no!—Think! Remember!” she whispered.
</p>

<p>
With a low laugh he sprang at her. She dodged quickly. Both of
them had become silent. Among the chairs and tables they went, swiftly,
silently, the pursuer and the pursued.
</p>

<p>
Into a corner of the room she got, where she could no longer elude
him. Near her sat the long coffin, its ends resting on black stands made
for the purpose. They struggled, and then as they stood breathless with
hot startled faces, there was a crash, the sound of broken glass and the
dead body of his brother with its staring eyes rolled, from the fallen
coffin, out upon the floor.

(<em>Apropos of recent criticisms of Imagism, vers libre, and modern
poetry generally.</em>)
</p>

<p class="aut">
ALICE CORBIN HENDERSON
</p>

<div class="hang">
<p>
Don’t confuse vers libre and Imagism. The two are not identical. One
pertains to verse, the other to vision.
</p>

<p>
Don’t attempt to “place” Imagism until you know what it is.
</p>

<p>
Don’t substitute irritability for judgement.
</p>

<p>
Don’t attempt to establish absolutes—positive or negative—by precedents
of a half or a quarter of a century, or a mere decade ago.
</p>

<p>
Don’t be a demagogue.
</p>

<p>
Don’t try to speak the last word—you can’t.
</p>

<p>
Don’t be dishonest with yourself. Analyze your own inhibitions.
</p>

<p>
Don’t believe that beauty is conventionality, or that the classic poets chose
only “nice” subjects.
</p>

<p>
Don’t forget that the age that produced the cathedrals produced also the
grotesques.
</p>

<p>
Don’t be afraid to expand.
</p>

<p>
Don’t deny the poet his folly, or expect him to appear always pompously on
stilts. Think of the poets who have fun in their make-up, and you
think of some of the greatest—Shakespeare, Chaucer, Villon,—(by
no means excepting Lewis Carroll, whose Jabberwock is almost
“<em>pure</em>” poetry and the poetic prototype of much excellent modern
painting.) Don’t relax your own appreciation of humor to the soft,
easy level of the newspapers.
</p>

<p>
Don’t squirm when a poet is a satirist. We need the keen vision. Not all
pessimism is unhealthy, and not all optimism healthy.
</p>

<p>
Don’t think that Spoon River is more sordid than Athens, Greece, or Athens,
Georgia, than Sparta or Troy, or—the Lake Shore Drive.
</p>

<p>
Don’t think that the poet must always <em>copy</em> something or somebody, and
that something usually of a recent date. Correspondences, to be
valuable, must be genuine and of the spirit, rather than of the letter.—When
Mr. Powys brackets the names of Chaucer and Edgar Lee
Masters, he is illuminating. When Mr. Hervey or Mr. Willard-Huntington-Wright
<a id="page-13" class="pagenum" title="13"></a>
discover each a different one of Mr. Masters’
copybooks, and publish their discoveries, the absurdity is manifest.
Picture Mr. Masters sitting with Robinson’s book in one hand, and
somebody’s Small Town in the other, inditing Spoon River with his
teeth!
</p>

<p>
Don’t expect a poet to repeat himself indefinitely, however much you may
admire his earlier work. You may appreciate his later work in time.
</p>

<p>
Don’t condemn the work of a man whose books you have not read. Unfortunately
there are no civil service examinations for critics.
</p>

<p>
Don’t think that competition is unhealthy for the poet, or that his poetry
suffers thereby.
</p>

<p>
Don’t be confident, as Mr. Arthur J. Eddy said at the “Poetry” dinner, that
no good thing is ever lost. Ask Mr. Eddy, who is a lawyer, to prove
that no good thing is ever lost.
</p>

<p>
Don’t expect poets to refrain from writing about one another—even in
praise. If you don’t enjoy the feast, don’t eat it. When the poets
tear one another to pieces, don’t you enjoy it? But if, like most
critics of poetry, you are a poet also, take warning. Be <a id="corr-4"></a>prepared!
</p>

<p>
Don’t wait until a poet is dead before you discover him.
</p>

<p>
Don’t gnash your teeth and expect the public to take it as a sign of force
and insight.
</p>

<p>
Don’t forget that prosody is derived from poetry, not poetry from prosody.
</p>

<p>
Don’t waste your time trying to squeeze exceptions into the rule. Remember
that exceptions in poetry, as in music, are the variations that give
life.
</p>

<p>
Don’t measure English poetry by English poetic standards alone. Consider
the sources of English poetry, and don’t begin with Chaucer,
or stop with Tennyson.
</p>

<p>
Don’t think that English or American poetry may not assimilate as much
new beauty and richness from foreign sources in the future as it
has in the past.
</p>

<p>
Don’t consider rhyme as the be-all and end-all of poetry. Rhyme is sometimes
as beautiful as the reflection of trees in water; it is sometimes
as monotonous as a stitch in time.
</p>

<p>
Don’t substitute vituperation for the “critique raisonné”—almost an unknown
quantity in this country.
</p>

<p>
Don’t look first at the publisher’s imprint.
</p>

<p>
Don’t cling to convictions that you fear to have upset.
</p>

<p>
Don’t, because you fail to share the convictions of a fellow critic, think that
he is a bigger fool than you are—unless you can prove it.
</p>

<p>
Don’t imagine that printing a poem as prose makes it prose. A musical
masterpiece may be distorted by unrhythmic playing, yet the composer’s
rhythm remains intact in the score.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-14" class="pagenum" title="14"></a>
Don’t object to conceptions in poetry that you might find striking and powerful
in bronze or plaster. “The Hog Butcher of the World” is one
picturesque attitude of Chicago.... Is the truth unbearable? One
may still love Chicago in spite of its dirty face.
</p>

<p>
Don’t try to establish even a distant kinship between poetry and ethics.
The relation is illicit.
</p>

<p>
Don’t tell the poet what he must, or must not, write about—he doesn’t
hear you.
</p>

<p>
Don’t be tedious.
</p>

<p>
Don’t take ten times as much space as the poet to prove that he is a bad
poet. Your sin against the public is more grievous, and your art
less, than his.
</p>

<p>
Don’t make up your review from the publisher’s advance notice. The poet
might like to know what you think about his work—not what he
told the publisher to tell you.
</p>

<p>
Don’t expect a poet to punch a time-clock, or record only the emotions of
his fellow townspeople.
</p>

<p>
Don’t limit a poet to primary emotions, or find decadence in a refinement
that may exceed your own.
</p>

<p>
Don’t fancy that brutality is strength, or delicacy weakness.
</p>

<p>
Don’t fancy that the poem that gives up its meaning quickest gives most,
or lives longest.
</p>

<p>
Don’t make the mistake of believing that vers libre is easier to write than
rhymed metrical verse—or the reverse.
</p>

<p>
Don’t think because you say a thing, it is so. Your venture is as uncertain
as the poet’s. Authority, unless bestowed by the Mayor, is the
gift of time; and then not unassailable.
</p>

<p>
Don’t reverence only dead poets or be certain that the dead poets would
think just as you do about contemporary poets.
</p>

<p>
Don’t discard the past for the future, or the future for the past. We learn
about the earth from the telescope, and about the stars from the
microscope.
</p>

<p>
DON’T be as negative as this list, or sit on the fence. It is better to be
on the wrong side than to straddle.

The Sealed Package
</h3>

<p class="noindent">
I will make it all into a package and put a heavy seal upon it, and
label it “To be destroyed unopened when I am dead.”
</p>

<p>
These nine black months. These memories that must be cut away—like
a cancer from the breast but without anaesthetics to deaden the pain. Cut
away altogether lest they threaten life and reputation and the honor of the
family.
</p>

<p>
Here is the signature of the man who caused it all, and the letter he
wrote when he knew the terrible truth.
</p>

<p>
It includes a perfunctory offer of marriage which I was too proud to
accept.
</p>

<p>
It also proves that I was virgin when he seduced me and protests that
had he believed in my virtue he never would have touched me.
</p>

<p>
Here is the paper from the registry office recording the birth of a male
child:—mother unmarried—father’s name withheld.
</p>

<p>
Here is the receipt for money paid on the adoption of a nameless child,
and the promise in my own handwriting to the woman who adopted him:—never
to make any further claims upon him—a resignation of all the rights
of motherhood.
</p>

<p>
The rest is misery in black and white.
</p>

<p>
A diary of stoic days and nights when even dreams were wet with
tears. An account of a secret sojourn in a strange city—veiled walks in
twilight streets—skulking in corners—lies—deceit—trickery—truckling to
convention. The copy of a prayer from Thomas-à-Kempis, and on the opposite
page a character sketch of the drunken and facetious landlady in
whose house the child was born.
</p>

<p>
Seal up the package.
</p>

<p>
If I look at it too long I am likely to go blind with rage at my own
weakness.
</p>

<p>
I am likely to go mad and pull down upon me the pillars of society.
</p>

<p>
I am likely to go mad and destroy the world—
</p>

<p>
Seal up the package—hide it away—
</p>

<p>
Forget—forget.

It Sojourns in a Strange Land
</p>

<p class="aut">
CHARLES ZWASKA
</p>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">W</span><span class="postfirstchar">e</span> were disappointed—and we had no right to be. Authorities say this
organization brings the music of the nineteenth century to its logical
conclusion. Logical—see? Authorities are always that. So let’s be logical
and philosophical and reason that what belongs to the nineteenth has no
place this far into the twentieth century. Granted. “Well, then, what <em>do</em>
you want?” they question. I should answer <em>The Faun</em> or something beyond
this, finding its manner and inspiration in this form—interpretive,
impressionistic, compressed, emotional. Of all the Ballets presented by
Diaghileff’s Ballet Russe that is, to me, the most indicative of what the
future is to be, so far as ballet and ballet music is concerned. We’ve had
Isadora Duncan, and Jacques Dalcrose has been at work. Following are
some impressions.
</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="noindent">
<span class="smallcaps">L’Oiseau de Feu.</span>—The setting an irritating green: scroll-work gates in
the background. Mere finical, petty child’s scribbling in its conventionalized
<a id="page-19" class="pagenum" title="19"></a>
balancing. The characters and their work about on the same level.
Bakst costumed them, but the strength of the Hunter’s garb is not carried
into his action—he’s a most unvirile huntsman. And the finale! a coronation:
quite the proper climax for this. Rather interesting though to have
curtain fall on the incoming procession. The music—Stravinsky’s—fascinating.
</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="noindent">
<span class="smallcaps">Schéhérazade.</span>—“Barbaric” they say—yes, it’s a harem scene, you know.
But broad and daring as Bakst’s color is it’s not <em>very</em> far from the <em>usual</em>
harem scene. The lighting was not as good as it should have been. A
serious offense, for the shadows interfered with the action several times;
but they aided the bizarreness of the kaleidoscopic whirl at the height of the
“barbarities.” This is known as “good ensemble work”—good, yes, but unusual?
No longer so. They say there are no “principals” in this very
modern ballet, but it seems that <em>one</em> person gets the “principal parts”—I
refer to Bolm. Right here I’d like to quarrel with his work—he is “principaled”
too often to escape notice. His Le Negre was lithe, one necessity
of the role, but it was nothing else! His supposedly ecstatic whirls would
break annoyingly. A tiny dressed-up monkey. The end of his leap to
Zobeide’s couch was most ungraceful, awkward. These same broken whirls,
leaps, and evident stumblings—they seemed nothing else—appeared in
<em>Prince Igor</em>. Seeing these two ballets on the same bill emphasizes this
persistent failing. He, as the Desired One and the Desiring in <em>Schéhérazade</em>,
made the infatuation rather absurd, inhuman. The Grand Eunuch,
strange to say, was the human one—his wavering and final surrender of
his duty to the caresses of the females! As a whole: all the passion, all
the “lust,” superbly expressed human-ness—“barbaric,” perhaps, but human.
</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="noindent">
<span class="smallcaps">Carnaval.</span>—A deep blue background—a background that <em>backs</em>. Two
settees, weak spots they seemed. But nevertheless, against and into this
blue came Pierrot, Schumann music, and Colombine. Pierrot seemed grotesque,
absurd—lovers usually do. Excellent pantomime, then other lovers
come upon the scene. Pierrot steps out of the picture into the dark outer
stage, his white and spots of springtime green lying in a heap in the center.
The lovers maneuver. After their not vain pursuits, momentary, yet so
poignant, Colombine returns to a most itching, subtle, ecstatic melody—and
with her is Arlequin!! The knave! see the curve of his back and the
curve of his thighs and legs! Pierrot must be in on this! and <em>Carnaval</em>
proceeds. Arlequin is now and then out of the picture posing on the frame,
the dark fore-stage, looking on: and in such moments we have all—everything
for our eyes, our ears and our hearts: color, movement, sound, in
themselves emotions but also emotions of hearts that are seeking.
</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="noindent">
<a id="page-20" class="pagenum" title="20"></a>
<span class="smallcaps">Les Sylphides.</span>—Genee. In what years was she at her height? And
how many generations preceded her as exponents of her particular form
of the Dance? I dare say “in those days” when the “people wanted” such
things they wanted them well done. “People” still want it, but evidently
not done well. The background—Belasco!—well, never mind that. The
<em>Chopiniana</em> that Rabinoff’s Russians did had at least finesse; this one has
terrible ragged edges. Even the solo works, waltzes, and prelude seemed
chosen with little taste—the presenting of the thing at all was offensive
taste.
</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="noindent">
<span class="smallcaps">Prince Igor.</span>—The red of the tents not “barbaric,” the paganism of
the costumes a trifle faded, and the leaps of the warriors (Bolm, the “chief
warrior,” you remember) not convincing. The mob, or “ensemble,” if you
must, properly wild and abandoned. The music is the kind that you beat
time to with your feet, you know—primitive I think they call it. Well, the
“very moderns” failed us again—do you see?
</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="noindent">
<span class="smallcaps">L’Après Midi d’un Faune.</span>—Green. Some how I was expecting
purple, the hazy opaque purple of a woodland when the sun enters it
from one side; and still I think that purple would have fitted the Debussy
music and the mood of the faun,—a mood, of course dependent on the
music. But it was green, with rather weak spots of red. This scene
framed by a Greek border of pale and dark blue and white. In front of
this frame, looking into the picture at the languid, piping faun, moved
nymphs. They seemed part of the border—a decoration from an urn or
from the walls of some temple. The faun leaves his knoll and moves into
the decorative sphere of the maidens. Beautiful movement, repressed, conventionalized.
A scarf is left by one of the maidens; they have all left the
faun. He has nothing but this to remember them by. Returning to his
mossy rock he possesses the scarf. No lover more delicately held the body
of his love or with more reverence knelt toward her. The curtain lowers
here—the faun is left to dream. “Now, look here, my friends,” as <em>the</em>
Lecturer would say, stamping across the stage; “away with all this nonsense
and hypocrisy, this clatter about ‘indecent,’ ‘revolting,’ ‘vicious,’ ‘offensive,’
‘decadent,’ and such blabber! Admit that your life, you critics, living for
art as you pretend to, is made up of just such things—in fact if you were
honest you’d admit your entire life is wholly, first and last, rooted, aye,
<em>dwelling</em> on just this episode, and yet you cry aloud unto the heavens ‘indecent,’
‘revolting,’ ‘offensive’ when it is beautifully simple and much more
perfectly presented before you than you’ll ever experience it yourself. And
as for the substitution of the scarf, well, the psychology of the incident
is perfect and the whole thing is heightened by art, my friends, <em>art</em>—and
you of course, living as you do amongst the fleshpots and the Market
<a id="page-21" class="pagenum" title="21"></a>
Place and knowing not of the Groves of Dionysius and the Temples on the
hillsides at Athens—can’t see it. Well. The gods have pity on you and
may you be shown joy in the hereafter—God knows your chastity will
keep you from it here.”
</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="noindent">
<span class="smallcaps">Le Spectre de la Rose.</span>—Fragmentary concession to those who
“loved” <em>Les Sylphides</em> and, botanically speaking, a “shoot” from that ballet
and the (unpresented here) <em>Papillons</em> of Schumann. Necessary, no doubt,
to remind us of our ballet history and, like historical data, necessary but
uninteresting. Bakst’s bedroom setting <em>does</em> justify the presenting of this,
however.

<p class="noindent">
<span class="smallcaps">Soleil de Nuit.</span>—M. Leonide Massine—<em>Youth!</em> If you were present
at creation’s turmoil perhaps <em>les Bergers</em> would always have been delightful
and <em>les Paysannes</em> always happy and colorful—and, of course, we would
have had many more serious and glorious Bouffons! The <em>purity</em> of this
ballet—color, music (Rimsky-Korsakov), dancing and pantomime—is
astounding, and beautiful!
</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="noindent">
<span class="smallcaps">Cleopatre.</span>—<em>I</em> have been to Egypt! All ages have known Cleopatra—her
evil and magnificence; and none will forget that she had slaves. No
age since hers can know of her allurements and the grandeur of her reign
of the souls of two of her slaves as the Russians have shown them to ours!
A temple in Egypt: of pillars once believed eternal, along the then sacred
Nile. Amoun, one of her slaves, loving and loved by another, Ta-or,
craves the caresses of the great Cleopatra! He succeeds: they are granted
midst colorful revels, music made by Assyrians and dancing by dancers
from Greece. The moment is too short ... he pays for it with his life.
The revelers leave, and none in their indifference so cold as the Queen herself.
In the thickness of a red evening, the hall deserted, one heart still
beats. Ta-or grieves over her lost love—alone. I have been to Egypt ...
learned the ways of women—and the world!
</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="noindent">
<span class="smallcaps">Petrouchka.</span>—Primary things: red, blue, yellow; love, hate, jealousy;
people and artists. All told together in a ballet whose dramatic unification
finds its remarkable inspiration in the music. No doubt Stravinsky’s most
important music for the stage. Pétrouchka, eternal paradox of beauty encased
in ugliness. His jealousy of the Moor, who also loves the Ballerine,
is the ballet, and the music. Foremost the music! Pétrouchka, in whirling
frenzy alone with night and the stars; the Ballerine haunting him with
piercing notes blown from a silver horn; his discovery of the Moor with
his love; and the mannekins entering into the public square, halting the folk-music
of the peasants and squires; Pétrouchka’s death in the snow and the
<a id="page-22" class="pagenum" title="22"></a>
appearance of his spirit. All these episodes are <em>music</em>. Here one gets
the ingenious use of an orchestra, extraordinary combinations of instruments.
Carpenter attempted this, you remember, in his <em>Perambulator</em>. Igor
Stravinsky has accomplished it. He with Leon Bakst, is the most important
figure of the Russian Triumph. They worked together to achieve
<em>Pétrouchka</em>.

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="noindent">
The agonizing lack of an audience excuses Diaghileff in laying aside a
completely perfect matinee program in favor of one that would attract
modern children with their innocent parents, but, artistically, there is no
justification of this bowing to the “public” and to “morals” in the reasoning
that moved them to tone down the color of the slaves in <em>Schéhérazade</em>. The
contrast was needed: black was in the color plan, especially for Le Negre.
This makes us suspicious that the other uneven and faulty spots were caused
by just such managerial schemings. Seeing some the second and third
times strengthened these suspicions! The journalistically “notorious faun”
on its third performance (a matinee) moved less lithely and, that there be
no “effrontery of good taste,” posed stupidly, stiffly, while the tense vibrating
music panted for <em>movement</em>—for entry into life. And <em>Cleopatre</em>!
Much as it was Americanized by being “less sensuous, etc.,” the second performance
descended to mere Grand Opera pageantry, or nearer, to a Grand
Opera Gala Performance vaudeville. The actual center of interest, the
Queen’s couch, was draped by a still, unamourous—yet Decency and the
Parents’ League be praised!—unoffensive lover.

<em>THE ESSENTIAL THING.</em>

<p class="first">
<span class="smallcaps"><span class="firstchar">T</span><span class="postfirstchar">he</span> Little Review</span> is a magazine of Art and Revolution. If
you ask me which it believes in most I shall have to say—Art.
Because there is no real revolution unless it is born of the
same spirit which produces real art.
</p>

<p>
A man like Bill Haywood doesn’t agree with this. “Why do
you ask why some one doesn’t start the revolution?” he says;
“don’t you see that we’re in the midst of a revolution now?” No,
I don’t see it. I see evolution at work in labor—not revolution.
But I see something more than evolution at work in the arts—music,
painting, poetry.
</p>

<p>
“... to obtain victory over man and circumstance there
is no other way but that of feeding one’s own exaltation and magnifying
one’s own dream of beauty or of power.” You can argue
that D’Annunzio, who said this, is neither a very great man nor
a very great artist. Nevertheless it is what Beethoven did; and
it is what Jeanne d’Arc did.... It is what Bill Haywood
does; but it is not what most labor leaders do, or what most
radicals do. It is not what the laborers themselves do. How
horrible it is to realize that when a man is slaving for his very
life he can not be selective in what he does, that he has no dream
left to magnify, and yet that he must have or perish....
</p>

<p>
This is why I would go to hear John Cowper Powys even if
he spoke in such a benighted place as the Hebrew Institute. Boycotts
are important, but they will not help a revolution as a dream
will. Mr. Powys will help you to find both an exaltation and a
dream....

“<em>DON’TS FOR CRITICS.</em>”
</h3>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">I</span> went to a meeting of the Friday Club the other day, where
Mary Aldis was to read a very good paper which she called “A
Passionate Inquiry into Imagism.” After she had finished, Harriet
Monroe rose to defend the poetry of H. D.—poetry which Mrs.
<a id="page-24" class="pagenum" title="24"></a>
Aldis had confessed left her unmoved. Miss Monroe “explained”
the miracle of such poetry as H. D’s <em>Oread</em> so that even those who
don’t “get” these things ought to have understood. And still—what
is the use? I am convinced that the secret and the beauty of
the Imagists lies somehow <em>in the look of the words</em>, and that if you
have only a feeling for the sounds of words you will never love
Imagism. Witter Bynner, who was also there, made an amusing
little speech about how the Imagists substitute color for sound, sensation
for emotion, and concentrate upon technique instead of upon
that for which technique is intended. And then Alice Corbin Henderson
had the last word. “After all the discussion about Imagism
I am surprised to find that no one really seems to know what it is!...
When Mrs. Aldis told me the title of her paper I said
that what I should like would be a dispassionate inquiry. She said
she didn’t think that possible—apparently it isn’t; but as I was
thinking over the many heated criticisms of Imagism and modern
poetry that have appeared lately, I began to make a list of Don’ts for
the critics.” (They are printed on another page). “Of course, if
the critics can’t find out what Imagism is there isn’t any need telling
them; though it might be well to point out again that it isn’t a
matter of technique: it is a matter of vision.”

The poems she has in the present number are part of a series
called <em>The Torch</em>, in which with sledge-hammer, burning accurateness
she paints the emotions of a woman, from childhood to

<em>BIRTH CONTROL</em>
</h3>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">M</span><span class="postfirstchar">argaret</span> Sanger’s case has been dismissed, “because
she is not a disorderly person”—and what has been gained
for the issue of birth control? Nothing, except perhaps a little
education through publicity; and that appears to be very little when
you reflect what has just happened to young Dr. Long, now lying in
jail in Chicago because of an abortion which resulted in the death
of his wife. Think of a society that dares to meddle in people’s
lives to the extent of making them face death rather than face
a scandal. Think of a doctor (the cad by the name of Goldstine,
I believe) who <em>notifies the police</em> as the proper agents to deal
with such a tragedy. Think of a public which makes it a crime
for these operations to be performed intelligently and without
danger of blood poisoning. Think of physicians who will not
fight for their right to do this. And think of splendid Dr. Haiselden!
</p>

<p>
Margaret Sanger has been “forgiven” by the government, but
the statutes regarding family limitation remain the same. Any
unfortunate unknown can be whisked into jail for propagating
birth control, just as usual. Mrs. Sanger didn’t even demand
redress for her husband, who spent a month in prison. Surely
he was entitled to a dismissal on the same grounds—more entitled
to it, even in the eyes of the law: he had never circulated the
pamphlets or in any way agitated for birth control. He is an
artist, not a propagandist. But he served his sentence, and nothing
was done or is being done about it. Mrs. Sanger means to go on
with her work. What does the government mean to do about it?
</p>

<p>
Emma Goldman is about to stand trial for the same “offense.”
In her case there will be no “influential” women rushing back and
forth to Washington to interview the President in her behalf.
I only wish there would be. It would insure her freedom for
the next year, and it would be so amusing to figure out on what
grounds the Good Presbyterian could effect the release of the
Arch Anarchist. But Emma Goldman will fight her case alone,
<a id="page-26" class="pagenum" title="26"></a>
and on its merits. If she does not succeed in effecting a revision
of the penal code regarding the whole matter of birth control she
will spend the next year in prison, I understand. You can all
help by sending your protests to Magistrate Simms and also
by giving your support to Dr. Long and Dr. Haiselden or any
other person who gets involved in these laws of the dark ages.

“<em>THE BEAUTIFUL GESTURE</em>”

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">W</span><span class="postfirstchar">hy</span> do you object to Jean Crones’ reasoning? I reprint his
second letter, transposed into English:
</p>

  <div class="excerpt">
<p class="noindent">
Why did I do it? While in Europe millions of Christians
are slaughtering each other in the most bloody massacre,
and in this free country thousands of men and
women are tramping the streets without food and shelter,
and at the same time the church holds dinners that cost
$15 a cover, beginning with Beluga caviar and champagne—the
money which was beggared from poor working men
and women, the money which the blood of poor workers
has run for.
</p>

<p>
These conditions are a scandal. This is the failure
of Christianity—an insult to honesty and a challenge to
humanity. Let the church answer my charges toward the
world and I shall stand for the charges made against me.

<h3 class="section" id="MOTORBUSSESONCHICAGOBOULEVARDS">
<em>MOTOR BUSSES ON CHICAGO BOULEVARDS.</em>
</h3>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">T</span><span class="postfirstchar">here</span> is really a definite plan on foot for this miracle. A
Motor Bus Company has been formed, and the necessary certificates
from the State Public Utilities Commission secured. Its
plan is to operate from the south end of Jackson Park to the
north end of the city limits. People who haven’t limousines, who
can’t afford taxis, and who can’t possibly walk the whole distance
of the parks, will be able to drive through the beautiful parts of
the city—the <em>only</em> beautiful parts, it is necessary to add. For
ten cents they can have an astounding romance. They can sit
on top of an omnibus, under the sun or the stars, and watch
<a id="page-27" class="pagenum" title="27"></a>
Lake Michigan stretching out to the other side of the world. That
is, they can do this if the Park Commissioners decide to allow them.
</p>

<p>
Some of these commissioners raise the objection that motor
busses will add seriously to the traffic congestion. That is true,
but how is the thing managed in New York? Fifth Avenue is
narrower than Michigan, and it is always more crowded. Other
commissioners object to the wear and tear on the boulevards which
have not been constructed for such heavy traffic. But the Chicago
Motor Bus Company “has agreed to pay the Lincoln Park Commissioners
$1,300 a year for each mile of their route and the
South Park Commissioners $1,000 a year per mile.”
</p>

<p>
The thing that really halts the plan at present is the attitude
of a couple of private citizens who complain to the South Park
Board that motor busses will destroy the beauty of the boulevards!
You know the type of mind whose thinking runs in such
channels? The type that doesn’t give a hang who pays the
taxes which maintain the boulevards; the type that is fond of
talking about democracy and what great things we do for the
foreigner in America.
</p>

<div class="filler">
<p class="noindent">
Of the men who rhyme, so large a number
are cursed with suburban comforts. A villa and
books never made a poet; they do but tend to the
building up of the respectable virtues; and for
the respectable virtues poetry has but the slightest
use. To roam in the sun and air with vagabonds,
to haunt the strange corners of cities, to
know all the useless and improper, and amusing
people who are alone very much worth knowing;
to live, as well as to observe life; or, to be shut
up in hospital, drawn out of the rapid current
of life into a sordid and exasperating inaction;
to wait, for a time, in the ante-room of death;
it is such things as these that make for poetry.

LUPO DE BRAILA
</p>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar"><span class="prefirstchar">“</span>M</span><span class="postfirstchar">isfit</span> clothing”—I saw these words this morning on a small shop
sign and they kept dancing before my eyes. Misfit clothing. In
vain all my attempts to concentrate on the object of my visit to the Art
Institute.
</p>

<p>
I sat down to search my brain for the cause of this phenomenon, and
I soon recalled another such visit I once made under similar difficulties.
</p>

<p>
It was at the San Francisco Exposition. I discovered by chance the
so-called Annex of the Fine Arts Building, a stable-like structure in comparison
to the main building. It housed the Norwegian, Hungarian, and
Spanish exhibits—by the way, almost the only ones worth seeing. At that
time another vision kept me from seeing the exhibit for some moments.
It seemed as if some short bald men danced along green velvet walls, each
one plucking his heart beats with gusto and, after arranging them in a
queer design on a crystal glass plate, offering them to the stars and children.
</p>

<p>
This recollection cleared the air and I realized that surroundings have
a strong effect on me. I have come to enjoy the result of the finest faculty
we possess, our imagination. I have come to admire the result of a year’s
work of our Chicago Artists.
</p>

<p>
Three hundred and twenty-one paintings, says my catalog; and in
order to simplify matters I decide to look at some of the most popular
names first—names usually found on the juries.
</p>

<p>
Artists, according to Rodin, are different from other mortals because
they love their work. Let us see: Adam Emory Albright, Alfred Juergens,
Lucie Hartrath, John F. Stacey, and Dahlgreen. Each one of them
<a id="page-30" class="pagenum" title="30"></a>
has between three and seven paintings. With all that canvas they must
have sailed on the most enchanting seas, and surely have brought back a
holiday for our eyes and hearts.
</p>

<p>
The first one I encounter is <em>An October Afternoon</em> by Mr. Alfred
Juergens; visions of little coral trees with hanging heads against a faint
green dream sky, embroidered brown leaves in the foreground and cool
blue hills like thoughtless sighs in the background, appear on the catalog
page. But see what Mr. Juergens has done with this subject. I
can scarcely believe my eyes. A mushroom dog in front of some formless
and lifeless trees; amateur composition, thoughtless technique, and dirty
color. And Mr. Juergens has a steady job on the jury. I wonder what
is his reason for painting: he certainly does not love his work. Something
suddenly interferes with my thoughts on this subject: it is the
jingling of coin in a visitor’s pocket. I look around and find number 174
by the same gentleman, and it reminds me of a cat walking on the keyboard
of a stringless piano.
</p>

<p>
They say this is the best exhibition of the Chicago Artists. If it
is, Mr. Juergens has done nothing to make it good. He has six such things
on the walls.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Albright, a painter of children playing in the open, has seven pictures
in the exhibit, five of them on one wall. One is called <em>The Barn
Yard</em>. The name reminds me of the reproduction of a painting by Malchevski
I saw in a Polish library a few days ago. It was called <em>Art in
the Back Yard</em> and showed a little satyr playing a flute for a little girl
and a few turkeys. There was romance in the fence boards, and marvelously
clean colors; it shouted life and joy. Mr. Albright’s old-maid’s
conception of childhood made me feel sad. His shapeless hens, his flattened
children on the wall, weak composition, dirty colors, and no sign
of life in the whole thing, or feeling of out-of-door air. Almost disgusted,
I look further:—<em>A Summer Dream</em>. I look for the dream and find it in
the fact that the biggest of the boys has borrowed his older brother’s
head, and the painting is full of some dirty yellow color. A horrible
dream. I wish Mr. Albright as well as Mr. Juergens would at least clean
their pallets if they can not change their conception of things.
</p>

<p>
Next I visit <em>Sunshine Alley</em>, by Lucie Hartrath. It is the alley of
poverty of ideas and bad color. Miss Hartrath evidently wants to paint
what she sees, but she does not happen to see anything startling. She, too,
has six such things on the walls.
</p>

<p>
The mediocre work of John F. Stacey and Anna L. Stacey really
deserves no attention. Especially bad is the portrait of John by Anna
(there is little love expressed in it) and <em>The Beach Road, Belvedere, California</em>,
by John, takes the prize for being the poorest painting in the exhibition.
John F. has only one painting that looks as if it were made by
a man who loves his work—<em>The Golden Hills of California</em>.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-31" class="pagenum" title="31"></a>
Next comes a man I dislike to place among the lollipop venders—he
being a very nice quiet and honest man; but why does Mr. Dahlgreen
paint?
</p>

<p>
Now, when I come to Messrs. Griffith and Irvine, I find their anaemic
work quite good in comparison to the work I have seen until now. Of
course, I did not expect paintings with as wide a scope as the work of
the Zubiaure Brothers, Zuologa, Edward Munch, Hodler, Welti, Malchevski,
Franz, Stuck, Fritz Erler, Putz, Elie Reppin, etc., to say nothing
of the latest developments of modern art and ideals—I mean the disciples
of Cezane, Matisse, Van Gogh, Gauguin, etc.—because Chicago is still
a frontier town. All the latest improvements plus the Art Institute cannot
change its real character: a frontier town with frontier town ideals.
In this case, all criticism being comparative, I did not look for the highest
standard. Had I done so, three words might have been my comprehensive
criticism. As it is, all I expected was clear feeling, clean color, good
design, and a certain amount of delicacy in handling. This has been fulfilled
only in a measure by Mr. Bartlett, whose strength and individuality
places him at the head of the landscape painters exhibiting. He reminds
me very much of Trubner, especially his <em>Autumn Afternoon</em>. I
also like his daring composition in <em>Under Chinese Tower, Munich</em>. Pauline
Palmer’s work is full of broadly-painted sunshine, though the foliage
in some of her trees seems too heavy and shapeless.
</p>

<p>
Next in merit I think comes Marie Lokke, whose yellow sail in <em>The
Old Pier</em> takes the wind out of many a neighbor. Hermann More’s <em>A
Summer Afternoon</em>, is a good example of clear feeling and clean color. I
also like Mr. Kraft’s delicate <em>Silver Mist</em> and <em>An Autumn Afternoon</em>, and
Mr. Ingerles’s, <em>The Fascinating Ozarks</em>.
</p>

<p>
There is also a class of painters who can best be described as able
and honest. At the head of these artists stands Mr. Peyraud and Edward
B. Butler. There are also Frank V. Dudley, H. Leon Roecker, Edgar S.
Cameron, J. H. Carlsen, Lawton Parker, Charles Francis Brown, A. H.
Schmidt, William Wendt, Alfred Jansson, Alson Clark, Karl A. Buehr,
Grace Ravlin, Edgar Payne and the following portrait painters: our own
Franz Hals, Mr. Christian Abrahamsen, Oscar Gross, Gordon Stevensen,
Cecil Clark Davis and Arvid Nieholm.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Werner’s mannerism is too monotonous.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Ufers and Mr. Higgins have taken yellow ochre into the open and
made good use of it. I have taken these two men separately because both
have done good work and I expect much improvement in the near future.
Their work at present looks too much like illustrations. Miss Dorothy
Loeb is the only one who has a real sense of rhythm in line.
</p>

<p>
The Chicago Society of Artists, which runs this exhibition every year,
seems to be controlled at present by a number of men who have inherited
a long-discarded weak imitation of a technique once used by Segantini.
<a id="page-32" class="pagenum" title="32"></a>
They have excluded almost everything that showed some originality and
feeling, but have accepted and hung a few very poor and meaningless
things, so that they may shine by contrast. However, it seems to me they
are at the end of the rope. The public refuses to buy the dope and their
best men have sent in nothing to this show. I refer to Clarkson, Reynolds,
Betts, Oliver Dennet Grover, Henderson, Rittman; and Lawton Parker
has only one little canvas.

A Vers Libre Prize Contest
</h2>

</div>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">T</span><span class="postfirstchar">hrough</span> the generosity of a friend, <span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span>
is enabled to offer an unusual prize for poetry—possibly the
first prize extended to free verse. The giver is “interested in all
experiments, and has followed the poetry published in <span class="smallcaps">The Little
Review</span> with keen appreciation and a growing admiration for the
poetic form known as <em>vers libre</em>.”
</p>

<p>
The conditions are as follows:
</p>

  <div class="linespace">
<p>
Contributions must be received by April 15th.
</p>

<p>
They must not be longer than twenty-five lines.
</p>

<p>
They must be sent anonymously with stamps for return.
</p>

<p>
The name and address of the author must be fixed to the
manuscript in a sealed envelope.
</p>

<p>
It should be borne in mind that free verse is wanted—verse
having beauty of rhythm, not merely prose separated into lines.
</p>

<p>
There will be three judges, the appointing of whom has been
left to the editor of <span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span>. (Their names will be
given in the next issue, as we are hurrying this announcement to
press without having had time to consult anyone.)
</p>

<p>
There will be two prizes of $25 each. They are offered not
as a first and second prize, but for “the two best short poems in
free verse form.”
</p>

<p>
As there will probably be a large number of poems to read,
we suggest that contributors adhere closely to the conditions of
the contest.

A. Neil Lyons
</h2>

</div>

<p class="book">
(<em>John Lane Company, New York</em>)
</p>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">A</span> roomy garret with a wee dirty window in the sloping roof. Some
trunks with old fine clothes and older musty books—books of hymns and
sermons, most of them were. Broken limp chairs. A fire that would not
“draw.” Bits of worn carpets on the floor. A smelly oil lamp on one of
the trunks. Such was the place of my solitary confinement, for rebellion,
at least once a week. I admit to having even deliberately whistled and
danced a highland fling on dreary Sundays in order to provoke my God-fearing,
Sabbath-respecting elders to send me to the garret! How could
they, unsuspecting, unimaginative Olympians, know that it was one of the
places where I had real joy?
</p>

<p>
In the smallest trunk there were back numbers of <em>Punch</em>. Pencils and
paper were there also. When the steps sounded no more on the stairs, and
I had stopped my stage crying, I would take out my drawing materials and
an issue of <em>Punch</em> and start to copy the easiest drawings I could find.
</p>

<p>
Among the artists there was none that I liked better than Phil May.
His sense of the comic and his economy of line appealed to me and my
lack of ability to draw. His Cockney folk gave me more pleasure than
any of the staid humans I knew. He....
</p>

<p>
But I forget myself. I started out to write of Neil Lyons.... All
the words I have spun for the prelude are merely to say that during my
re-reading of the work of Neil Lyons in the past few months I have been
struck again and again by its likeness to the drawings of Phil May: the
same joy, the same delight was there in the reading as there was in the
contemplation of the drawings.
</p>

<p>
Now, this likeness not only existed in the handling of the subject, but
also in the choice thereof. The Cockney men, women and children that
Phil May has drawn Neil Lyons has written about. The pictures of the
peasantry that May has left are alike in line and spirit to those Lyons has
drawn verbally in <em>Cottage Pie</em> and <em>Moby Lane</em>.
</p>

<p>
If you know Phil May’s work think of one of his drawings of a fat
middle-aged woman, and then listen to this drawing of another, by Neil
Lyons:
</p>

<div class="excerpt narrow">
<p class="noindent">
“She was forty years old
at a venture. She had lots
of mouth and a salmon-coloured
face and a pretence
<a id="page-34" class="pagenum" title="34"></a>
of a nose and small watery
eyes. All these amenities
were built up on a triple
foundation of chin, which
was matched by an exceeding
amplitude of bosom
and waist.”
</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">
Don’t you recognize the same swift, sure lines?
</p>

<p>
But I must get away from this parallel. Never at his best is the artist
as great as the writer. There is no line or collection of lines in May’s work
to match this in Lyons’:
</p>

<div class="excerpt narrow">
<p class="noindent">
“Mrs. Godge, who was
lately the mother of twin
babies, is now the mother
of memories.”
</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">
That sentence is only a shadow of the quiet poignancy of the tale that
follows it. Oh, the wonder of the man who can see every side of the common
people and set them down with such verve, such relish, such keen
poignancy and hilarious joy! Let me quote from the story of blind Unity
Pike, “the wanton”:
</p>

<div class="excerpt narrow">
<p class="noindent">
“I imagine poor old Unity
at this period of her life as
having been a little, fresh,
dark-haired maiden of
Quaker habit. I know she
must have been beautiful
because <span class="smallcaps">ALL</span> young things
are beautiful. I imagine
this poor bound soul in the
dark with its toil and its
thoughts—half-formed
thoughts, half-formed
memories, half-formed
wishes. Nothing real about
her or within her save the
darkness. And I can imagine
how it was, therefore,
that——
</p>

<p>
“Yes! They found Jack
Munsey in her cottage.
They found him in the
night. And so, in the
name of Christ, whose
name they give to all their
<a id="page-35" class="pagenum" title="35"></a>
wickedness—that Christ,
who forgave a woman that
was not blind for sins
beside which this sin of
Unity’s was pure and white—in
the name of this God,
I say, they seized her
sightless, wondering soul
and threw it, a sacrifice, to
those bloody wolves they
call their virtue.”
</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">
I would fain go on quoting, showing you the wit of this man, gentle,
and on occasion barbed and stinging: his humor, kindly, of the soil; his
great jollity and high good spirits. I would indeed like to introduce you
to “Clara,” the hussy, who is fat and motherly and with a heart and mind
unbounded. I would like to take you to “Arthur’s,” the midnight coffee-stall
where you would meet with street-walkers and soldiers, scavengers
and tramps and hear from the lips of a gutter snipe one of the most perfect
and touching love tales ever told.
</p>

<p>
Oh, but you must read them all yourself. Will you, if I give you the
names of the various volumes? Here they are, then: <em>Arthur’s</em>, <em>Sixpenny
Pieces</em>, <em>Cottage Pie</em>, <em>Clara</em>, <em>Simple Simon</em>, <em>Moby Lane</em>.

the world <em>The Yellow Book</em>, the works of Anatole France and Stephen

<h3 class="section" id="ANARCHY">
<em>ANARCHY</em>
</h3>

<p class="from">
<em>Alice Groff, Philadelphia</em>:
</p>

<p>
Anarchy is scientifically a reductio ad absurdum and those who claim to be
anarchists are self-deceivers,—minds that cannot complete a circuit of reason. There
is no place in reason for anarchy, hence there is not and cannot be an anarchist on a
basis of reason. All who call themselves so are either <em>archists</em> of the most rabid sort
or helpless flies in the sticky syrup of laissez faire. The only professed anarchists
that make any impression upon the world are of three kinds: either they are spirits
of revolt of the most bitterly, materialistically tyrannical sort; or they are those who
suffer with the oppressed and strive individually to set them free, even to the point
of <em>self</em>-martyrdom; or they are sentimentalists who maunder maudlinly on about love
and justice and yet do absolutely nothing to bring about the love of justice or the
justice of love, either in their preaching or their practice. But none of these are
really anarchists, they are only varieties of <em>archists</em> who wish to impose their <em>own</em>
social ideals upon the social order in place of those that already prevail.
</p>

<p>
The whole story of social evolution in a nutshell is as follows: every phase of
the social order at any stage of social evolution is maintained by a social ego or group
sufficiently powerful to dominate the rest of the surrounding social body,—and this
phase can be changed only by revolution—bloodless or otherwise,—on the part of a
new social ego desiring this change and developing power to establish and maintain it.
</p>

<p>
Now the only way in which such a social ego can develop such power is by obtaining
control of <em>the means of living</em>,—food, clothing, shelter, and the natural and financial
resources back of these means; and this control can be obtained only by <em>archists</em>,—<em>dominationists</em>,—organized
into a social ego or group that is a unit on any special
social ideal. Rebellions come and rebellions go, but the only rebellion that ever
reaches successful revolution is made by a social ego powerful enough to get control
of the necessities of life <em>by force</em>,—force material, intellectual, or psychic. This disposes
forever of the professed repudiation of force by the philosophical anarchists,
so-called. As for the poetic anarchists, who draw moving pictures of the beautiful
time to come, when humanity will voluntarily organize to abolish all man-made law
(which <em>they</em> consider the only social evil, not realizing that the evil is not in law,
per se, but in the <em>kind</em> of law), and who look to “Mother Nature” for social guidance,—these
will wait and look till the crack of doom, in vain. For “Mother Nature” is an
old-wife of incredible stupidity, socially considered, and must needs be pulled up by
the hair of her head at every whip-stitch, by her ever-evolving offspring, in order that
they may transform her social stupidity into scientific truth. Social evolution depends
entirely upon the discovery of such scientific truth and its application to the social
order, and such application can be made only step by step through a social ego powerful
enough to compel such application.
</p>

<p>
From this it may be seen that by whatever name we may call ourselves,—monarchists,
democrats, anarchists,—we are really <em>archists</em> striving to impose our ideals
as social egos upon the social order, and succeeding—only when we can get control
of the means of living—in dominating the rest of the social body with them,—until a
new social ego gets the power to cry “The king is dead! Long live the king!”
</p>

<p>
It, of course, goes without saying that no social dominance has ever been entirely
wise or beneficent, and that until very recently in social history there has been no
knowledge of sociological scientific truth to speak of upon which to base social domination.
But the hope of the world lies in the ever-progressing discovery of such
truth, and in its application to the social order by ever-evolving social egos that will
more and more base their social ideals upon such truth, gradually dominating the
whole social order with ideals so based.

<em>Anonymous</em>:
</p>

<p>
After having read your “A Deeper Music” in the February issue I wondered
whether you had ever heard Mr. de Pachmann play the piano. There is nothing in
the world like it—nothing more wonderful. I am not speaking of an ebony Mason
and Hamlin alone on a stage, but of any piano at all, with that madman bending his
head over the keys of it.
</p>

<p>
I feel sure that had you heard him you would have included him in your article
and would not have put words into Bauer’s mouth. You would have known that it is
possible to play the piano very badly and play it more beautifully than any one else;
both of these in one afternoon. The design of sound! But he, too, is becoming passé
like Paderewski. But there is little likelihood of a type arising from these two.
</p>

<p>
Do you know of any one who plays the piano as Casals plays the ’cello?
</p>

<p>
Have you looked at any of Scriabine’s later piano pieces? I wonder if he expresses
any of the moods which you prophesy will be caught by some new composer.
I knew a boy in Petrograd who went to the conservatory every day with a volume
of Scriabine and one of Bach under his arm. We called him the “Scriabine chap.”
He probably has had thirty-second quavers punched into him by a German machine
gun, for I am sure he couldn’t or didn’t dare be as loyal to both Nicholas and Wilhelm
as he was to Scriabine and Johann S. B.
</p>

  <div class="note">
<p>
<em>Yes, I have heard Pachmann many times, and he was always wonderful. I meant, of
course, to put him in the article, but at the last minute he slipped my mind ... perhaps
because I was trying to write of a “deeper” music, and since Pachmann is “master
of the small essential thing and master of absolutely nothing else” he doesn’t quite
come into the realm of the new vision of the piano.</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>Isn’t there a good deal of similarity between Casals’ playing of the ’cello and
Bauer’s playing of the piano?</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>Scriabine’s later piano things have something of what I meant, and do you remember
the piano parts of “Prometheus?” Stravinsky, too—you know how he uses the
piano in “Pétrouchka.” But the new vision is beyond these—something more rich and
shattering.... I can’t say it. Let’s just wait and see.—The Editor.</em>
</p>

  </div>
<p class="from">
<em>Alice Groff, Philadelphia</em>:
</p>

<p>
“Spirit can do” absolutely <em>nothing</em>, without body. Social spirit can do absolutely
nothing without the means of life for the body. The social ego that would
“start the revolution” must aim first to get control of the means of living—food,
clothing, shelter, and the resources, natural and economic, back of these. Revolutions
succeed only when they get such control; if they do not get it they are soap bubbles
blown by a little child.
</p>

<p>
Why waste time pelting with idle words the social egos that have such control,
instead of going to work to <em>wrench</em> it from them, <em>even with war</em>?
</p>

<p>
The social ego that has such control “can do anything.” It can stop war with
a turn of its hand and establish in its stead world-wide service, kindness, brotherhood,
peace, joy and beauty. And there is nothing else in the universe that can
do this.
</p>

<p>
It is for lack of a social ego having such control and that unity in establishing
the above-mentioned principles in the social order, alone, that “men continue to
support institutions they no longer believe in, that women continue to live with men
they no longer love, that youth continues to submit to age it no longer respects,” and
it is the only agency that can help one to be free when one wants to be free or
make one a personality instead of a nonentity.
</p>

<p>
All that you say about a “deeper music” is true, though I would say a more
winged music—(I would not dare use to you the word spiritual)—or a subtler music,
or something of that sort; but all that you deprecate in music, by critical suggestion,
is also true and necessary, scientifically and fundamentally, without which your
deeper or higher or subtler or more winged or more spiritual music would be nothing
but soap bubbles without plenty of soapy water to make them out of. I am
one of those who can appreciate this deeper music—but I know also that it cannot
be created ex-nihilo.
</p>

<p>
As to Ben Hecht, his power of expression is wonderful. His writing is literature
par excellence, but it lacks a <em>soul</em>. If in his meticulous analyses of life he
could suggest the vision of the swallowing up of the macrocosm in the macrocosm—could
suggest what humanity as a whole could do to wipe out the evils that feed
upon the individual—he might be god-like. But like all of the rest of you he is a dead
<a id="page-38" class="pagenum" title="38"></a>
fly in the sickening syrup of <em>laissez faire</em>, at the mercy of Mother Nature. Now
it isn’t worth while for you to resent this. Go to work and read what I have been
able to get out of <em>The Egoist</em>, showing up anarchy for all that it is worth.

<em>Edgcumb Pinchon, Los Angeles</em>:

<p>
Glad to see you get into trouble—you have the Flame! May it flash on our
universal dullness and faithlessness as the sun on sword blades——
</p>

<p>
Do you remember Maupassant’s story: An exhausted French regiment—ten
miles to go—the men mutinous, disgruntled; a broken-down carriage by the road-side—horses
and driver gone—a mother and her daughter forlorn in the carriage,
needing assistance to the next town. The snow is deep, their slippers are thin and
they are fashionably—and uselessly—garbed. The soldiers make a sedan chair of
the carriage poles, and fighting among themselves for the honor of bearing a hand
at the poles they finish the march with spirit and bravado——?
</p>

<p>
Do you remember Whitman’s “lithe, fierce girls?” Such are the flame-tongues of
Revolution—the priestesses of social passion.
</p>

<p>
If Woman only knew her power to work white magic with banality and stir up
the hero-poet in man! But we who have dragged her by the hair for ten thousand
years must continue to drag her enfeebled body and spirit with us for penalty—even
as we are praying her to touch us to Fire!
</p>

<p>
When you say that all we need at this hour is a few great spiritual leaders—you
are tremendously right. And shall not one of those be some “lithe fierce girl” who
knows how to wake the militant social troubadour in man?
</p>

<p>
The enclosed is because you, like Margaret Sanger, belong to the new revolution—the
thoroughbred thing compact of esprit, audacity, faith, and elan.

<em>A STUDY OF THE GREAT WAR
OF IMPERIALISM.</em>
</p>

<p>
Organized Socialism collapsed
in the European crisis; but Socialist
thought is providing us with an
authentic, realistic interpretation of
the causes and consequences of the
Great War.
</p>

<p>
The whole world is interested in
the attitude and conclusions of
the Socialists.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Boudin’s book deals with
the prime cause of the war—Imperialism.
He makes us understand
the underlying forces of this world-drama.
Mr. Boudin indicates that Imperialism
is the political expression of
a change in the economics of Capitalism;
that Imperialism is motivated
upon the export of capital, principally
in the form of iron and steel as
“means of production” in undeveloped
countries.
</p>

<p>
All phases of the war are covered,
including the “cultural”
and “racial”. The historian, the economist
and the sociologist unite in a
volume of the utmost interest and importance.

<p>
Having achieved in the Mason &amp; Hamlin, the most
beautiful piano tone the world has ever known, its
makers, many years ago, set before themselves the
problem of maintaining for all time, that which they
had created.
</p>

<p>
A system of highly tempered steel rods, running
from various points of the grand piano rim to a common
center, was evolved and termed the Mason &amp;
Hamlin Tension Resonator.
</p>

<p>
This construction, which is to be found in no other
piano, because patented, is the only known method of
permanently preventing deterioration of tone quality
through the otherwise inevitable flattening of the sounding-board.
</p>

<p>
Harold Bauer was the first artist to use a Mason &amp;
Hamlin Tension Resonator Piano in public. In the
fifteen years which have followed that epoch making
event there have been but few really great artists who
have not enthusiastically endorsed this great master’s
final choice.

Ignorance Is the Great Curse!
</p>

<p>
Do you know, for instance, the scientific difference between love and passion?
Human life is full of hideous exhibits of wretchedness due to ignorance of sexual
normality.
</p>

<p>
Stupid, pernicious prudery long has blinded us to sexual truth. Science was
slow in entering this vital field. In recent years commercialists eyeing profits have
unloaded many unscientific and dangerous sex books. Now the world’s great
scientific minds are dealing with this subject upon which human happiness often
depends. No longer is the subject tabooed among intelligent people.
</p>

<p>
<b>We take pleasure in offering to the American public, the work of one of the
world’s greatest authorities upon the question of sexual life. He is August
Forel, M.D., Ph.D., LL.D., of Zurich, Switzerland. His book will open your
eyes to yourself and explain many mysteries. You will be better for this
knowledge.</b>

Every <em>professional man and woman</em>, those dealing with social, medical, criminal,
legal, religious and educational matters will find this book of immediate value.
Nurses, police officials, heads of public institutions, writers, judges, clergymen
and teachers are urged to get this book at once.
</p>

<p>
The subject is treated from every point of view. The chapter on “love and other
irradiations of the sexual appetite” is a profound exposition of sex emotions—Contraceptive
means discussed—Degeneracy exposed—A guide to all in domestic
relations—A great book by a great man.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
